<h1>Funding for GONIAT online</h1>
<p>GONIAT online had been initially funded by the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft). All consecutive work, like fixing of minor bugs and database updates has been sponsored by elementec Software & Consulting. Also hosting and the domain fees have been sponsored by elementec up to now.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, elementec does not have the resources to push forward GONIAT online as it would be necessary. The main concern currently is, that the antiquated 16-bit-Windows applicaton, which is needed to maintain and update the database, doesn't work in current (Win7) and future Windows operating systems. The obvious solution would be to enhance the online program, such that data can be entered and updated directly. Also, there is plenty of room for improvements of the research functions in GONIAT online.</p>

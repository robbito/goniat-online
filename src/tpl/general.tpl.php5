<h1>General Information</h!>

<h2>GONIAT database</h2>
	
GONIAT is designed as a tool for investigations of Paleozoic ammonoids, their
paleogeographic distribution, and their biostratigraphic range. The underlying
database provides not only determinations based on morphological
characteristics, but also information on occurrence, duration, literature,
and phylogenetic relationships of every taxon of family, genus, and species
levels.
<br /><br />
<h2>History</h2>
The development of GONIAT was initiated by Prof. Dr. Juergen Kullmann at the
University of TÃ¼bingen. Over several decades he and his team have collected the
scattered data, that is now available publicly through GONIAT online.<br />
<br />
GONIAT was initially implemented with dBase IV. Later the frontend was
reimplemented as Windows application and used Microsoft Access as database.
The downloadable 16-bit Windows version of GONIAT is still available
<a href="goniat_desktop.html">here</a>.<br />
<br />
GONIAT and GONIAT online were realized from 1989 through 2008 with the help of
research grants from the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, KU 164/8-1 and
KU 164/16-1).<br />
<br />
<h2>GONIAT online software</h2>
The GONIAT online web application is open source and depends only on open
source components. The source code for the GONIAT research frontend and the
editing backend can be acquired by contacting <b>info</b> at <b>goniat</b> dot
<b>org</b>.
<br /><br />
GONIAT online is also meant as a reference system for biological and
paleontological databases and as such is well-suited to be transferred to other
fossil or animal/plant groups (see <a href="technical.html">Technical
	information</a>).
<br /><br />
<h2>Hosting</h2>
Hosting and technical maintenance is provided and sponsored by Software &amp;
Consulting Dr. Peter Kullmann.
